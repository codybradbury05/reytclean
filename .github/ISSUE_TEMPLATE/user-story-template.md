As a site user, I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view.

AC1 - "Given more than one post in the database, these multiple posts are listed."
AC2 - "When a user opens the main page a list of posts is seen."
AC3 - "Then the user sees all post titles with pagination to choose what to read."
